## Preface:

You wake up in a room, a wooden bedside table with a piece of blank paper and pencil lies in front of you. The walls of the room are white of an unbreakable matter, the room is about 4 square meters. Inside the furniture, pages with notes written with your handwritting, you have no recollection.

You wake up in a room, a wooden bedside table, a blank page and a pencil. You write something.

You wake up, documents found in the desk warns you about the room. You hide inside.

You don't fall asleep, when you open the door, you are also standing outside. You exchange sights, you both realize that only one can fit inside the desk. You should have a brought the pencil with you, you failed to defend yourself.

Manuscripts tells of the persistance of the inside of the desk, you are wise, you build it inside out. You don't fall asleep, another you eventually emerge from the desk with a pencil and a piece of paper.

You wake up, you find a limb inside the furniture.

You have been awake for days, sitting on the furniture, you await the moment when the door will open again and you can add a stroke to your page, a corpse to the floor.
