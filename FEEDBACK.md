## Request for feedback

Below are a few questions that we would like your help with, once you have had a chance to look at the [preview.pdf]() file.

### Clarity

While the book is missing final formatting, the texts are complete. Can you make sense of the story? Or what do you understand the story to be?

### Missing Angles

We think that we have explored most of the non-violent avenues of the system, but we might have overlooked some things. Are there options that we have not illustrated that you think would add to the story, and if so, which character type would it be attached to, in your opinion.

### E-Reader Support

Could you upload the [preview.pdf]() on your e-reader(Kindle, etc) and tell us if it displays clearly?

### Anything else?

What do you think of the book, the layout, the cover? Would you read it, is it suitable for children? 

### Translation Help

We need help translating the texts into french, russian and Japanese. If you think that you can help with that, please have a look at [main.rb]().

#### Cheers!

Thanks a lot! We're looking forward to reading your feedback :)
